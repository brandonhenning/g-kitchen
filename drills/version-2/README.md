## Meeting Mystery: Round 2

To successfully complete this drill, you need to facilitate a meeting that includes every participant _and_ solves a mystery. The meeting you run should have least 3 participants, and last 5 minutes or less. As the facilitator, you are required to post and annouce the meeting agenda and ensure that every partcipant has an opportunity to contribute to the discussion. 

Before the meeting, participants should pick roles and a mystery. Don't tell the person facilitating the meeting. 

Roles: 
- A quiet person who doesnâ€™t say anything unless asked 
- A person who talks a lot 
- A remote team member (this person should call into the meeting using Google Meet, or another video conferencing platform)
- A 'know it all' 
- Someone with imposter syndrome: they have good ideas, but they end every thought with, "... but I don't actually know."
